# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
## RuralDemand AI — Smarter Forecasts. Stronger Rural Businesses.

**Track:** Software Industry & MSME Innovation
**Problem Statement:** AI-powered demand prediction system for village enterprises
**Version:** 1.0 (Hackathon Submission)
**Status:** Draft for Build

---

## 1. Problem Statement

Village and rural micro-enterprises (kirana stores, dairy vendors, oil/flour mills, spice traders, handicraft units, small retailers) run almost entirely on gut feeling. They don't track historical sales in any structured way, have no visibility into seasonal or festival-driven demand swings, and can't see market price trends until it's too late.

This leads to three recurring, compounding losses:

1. **Overproduction / overstocking** — perishable or capital-locking goods pile up and lose value.
2. **Stockouts** — high-demand items run out during peak windows (festivals, monsoon, harvest season), and the sale is lost to a competitor or simply lost.
3. **No planning discipline** — production and procurement decisions are reactive, not data-driven, so profitability swings unpredictably month to month.

There is no affordable, simple, vernacular-friendly tool built for this segment. Enterprise ERP/forecasting tools are too complex, too expensive, and assume literacy in spreadsheets and English business jargon that rural entrepreneurs don't have.

## 2. Vision

Give every village enterprise the same demand-sensing power a large FMCG distributor has — a simple mobile-first dashboard that says, in plain language: *"make more of this, order less of that, this is coming next week."*

## 3. Goals & Success Metrics

| Goal | Metric (Target for MVP demo) |
|---|---|
| Accurate demand forecasting | ≥85% forecast accuracy (MAPE-based) on 7-day horizon using historical + seasonal data |
| Reduced inventory losses | Reduce simulated overstock/stockout incidents by ≥25% vs. no-forecast baseline |
| Improved production planning | Deliver a "recommended production" number per product, updated daily |
| Increased business profitability | Show projected revenue impact of following AI recommendations |
| Better market responsiveness | Surface price/demand trend alerts within 24 hours of a market shift |

## 4. Target Users / Personas

## 7. AI / Forecasting Approach

**Core model:** Time-series demand forecasting per product/category, using a hybrid approach suited to sparse rural sales data:
- **Baseline:** Moving average / exponential smoothing (Holt-Winters) for early-stage businesses with limited history.
- **Primary model:** Facebook Prophet or SARIMA for seasonality + trend decomposition (handles festival/monsoon seasonality well with minimal tuning — good hackathon fit).
- **Stretch model:** Gradient-boosted trees (XGBoost/LightGBM) with engineered features once enough data exists, for higher accuracy.

**Input features:**
- Historical sales (date, product, quantity, price)
- Calendar effects (day of week, festival calendar, harvest season)
- Weather signals (rainfall, temperature — via weather API)
- Market price trend (mandi/wholesale price API or manually entered)
- Local events/promotions (manual flag)

**Outputs:**
- Per-product 7-day unit forecast with confidence level
- Category-level aggregated forecast
- Recommended production/reorder quantity = forecasted demand + safety stock − current inventory
- Plain-language recommendation text generated from the top 1–2 drivers (e.g., "Turmeric demand rising due to festival season — increase stock by 20%")

**Fallback for cold-start businesses (no history):** category-level benchmarks from similar businesses/region (anonymized, aggregated) until the business accumulates 4+ weeks of its own data.

## 8. Technical Requirements (Non-Functional)

- **Performance:** Dashboard loads in <2s on 3G/4G rural connectivity; charts must degrade gracefully on low bandwidth.
- **Accessibility:** Large tap targets, high-contrast UI, minimal text-per-screen, iconography-led navigation for lower digital literacy.
- **Localization:** UI copy structured for easy translation (Hindi + regional languages) — English-only acceptable for hackathon MVP, flagged as immediate roadmap item.
- **Data privacy:** Business sales data is private per account; only anonymized/aggregated data used for cold-start benchmarks or market trend indices.
- **Reliability:** Forecast recompute daily (batch) with manual "Refresh" option.
- **Scalability:** Architecture should support multi-tenant village enterprises across regions without per-business infrastructure.

## 9. Suggested Tech Stack (Hackathon-Feasible)

| Layer | Suggestion |
|---|---|
| Frontend | React + Tailwind CSS (matches existing high-fidelity mockups), Recharts/Chart.js for visualizations |
| Backend | Node.js (Express) or Python (FastAPI) |
| Database | PostgreSQL (relational: businesses, products, sales, inventory) |
| ML/Forecasting | Python: Prophet / statsmodels (SARIMA), scikit-learn |
| Auth | JWT + OTP via SMS gateway (e.g., MSG91/Twilio) |
| External APIs | OpenWeather (weather), AgMarknet / state mandi price APIs (market price) |
| Hosting | Vercel/Netlify (frontend), Render/Railway (backend), for hackathon demo speed |

## 10. Hackathon Build Plan (Suggested Milestones)

| Phase | Deliverable |
|---|---|
| Hour 0–4 | Finalize PRD/DESIGN (this doc), set up repo, DB schema, seed sample rural-business dataset |
| Hour 4–10 | Build auth + business onboarding, CSV sales import, base dashboard shell (matches mockups) |
| Hour 10–18 | Implement forecasting model (Prophet/SARIMA) on seed data, wire Demand Prediction + Inventory Planning screens |
| Hour 18–26 | Build Sales Analytics, Inventory Management, Market Trends screens with live/mock data |
| Hour 26–32 | Alerts engine (threshold-based), Forecast Reports (PDF export), Settings |
| Hour 32–38 | Polish UI to match mockups, mobile responsiveness pass, plain-language AI recommendation copy |
| Hour 38–42 | End-to-end testing, demo data curation, judge-facing narrative/pitch deck |
| Hour 42–48 | Buffer, bug fixes, rehearsal |

## 11. Risks & Assumptions

- **Assumption:** Village enterprises can access a smartphone with basic internet (2G/3G/4G) — no assumption of desktop access.
- **Risk:** Sparse/no historical sales data for new users → mitigated via cold-start category benchmarks.
- **Risk:** Market price/weather API rate limits or unavailability in some regions → mitigated with cached/mock fallback data for demo.
- **Risk:** Trust in "black box" AI recommendations → mitigated by always showing the *why* (Prediction Factors, AI Insight narrative) alongside every number.

## 12. Expected Outcomes (Recap per Problem Statement)
